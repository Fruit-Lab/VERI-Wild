# VERI-Wild
A Large-Scale Dataset for Vehicle Re-Identification in the Wild

## Challenge Description
Vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of a query vehicle from a large-scale vehicle database, which is of great significance to the urban security and city management. However, to the best of our knowledge, all of the existing vehicle ReID datasets are captured under constrained conditions, and generally have limitations in the following aspects: 

(1) The number of vehicle identities and images are not large enough to the needs of practical application. 

(2) The limited camera numbers and covering areas do not involve complex and variant backgrounds in a variety of real-world scenarios. 

(3) The camera views are highly restricted as shown in Figure 1. For most vehicle datasets, the samples are collected from checkpoint cameras that only capture the front and rear views, and the severe occlusion is also not taken into consideration. 

(4) Most of current datasets are constructed from short-time surveillance videos without significant illumination and weather changes. The purpose of this competition is to promote research and development on unconstrained wild vehicle ReID, especially in complex situations, e.g. high viewpoint variations, extreme illumination conditions, complex backgrounds, and different camera sources.
