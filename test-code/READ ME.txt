#VeRI-Wild
This folder lists the  evaluation code for the VeRI-Wild dataset.

In the ReID process, for each given query, a candidate list sorted by the feature distances between the query and
reference images is returned from the database. 

The mean Average Precision (mAP) and Cumulative Matching Characteristics (CMC) are used as performance metrics.

Note that, given a query image, we remove the images with the same camera id and same vehicle id in the gallery set. They are not considered when computing the mAP and CMC.
