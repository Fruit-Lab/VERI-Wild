#VeRI-Wild
This folder lists the  evaluation code for the VeRI-Wild dataset.

In the ReID process, for each given query, a candidate list sorted by the feature distances between the query and
reference images is returned from the database. 

The mean Average Precision (mAP) and Cumulative Matching Characteristics (CMC) are used as performance metrics.

Note that, given a query image, all of the reference images in gallery set are involved in the calculation of CMC and mAP.
